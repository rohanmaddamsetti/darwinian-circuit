i tried to set up this code using dcc. Copying the links here in case you are interested.
The first one is DCC on demand, you can run Jupyter lab on it directly. The second link is the instruction.

What I did was to make a folder in my home directory, upload the data and code, and run it using jupyter lab. It was smooth for me.

When setting up the VM, it allows you to choose # of cpu, gpu.
